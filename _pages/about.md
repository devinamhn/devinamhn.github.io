I am a second year PhD student working at the intersection of deep learning and astrophysics at the University of Manchester, supervised by Prof. Anna Scaife. I am interested in exploring the potential of Bayesian neural networks (BNNs) and probabilistic programming for scientific application. I have previously used variational inference to perform uncertainty quantification for Radio Galaxy Classification. I am now using MCMC based BNNs for extracting well-calibrated neural network posteriors that will enable astronomers to extract meaningful scientific information from large datasets. 

<!-- In the future, I hope to play a role in operationalising AI systems for the next-generation of radio astronomy facilities such as the Square Kilometre Array which is expected to produce exabytes of data over its lifetime. -->
