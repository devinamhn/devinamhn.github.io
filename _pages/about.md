I am a final year PhD student working at the intersection of deep learning and astrophysics at the University of Manchester. I am interested in exploring the potential of Bayesian neural networks and probabilistic programming for scientific application.

Research interests: uncertainty quantification in deep learning, approximate Bayesian inference for neural networks, generalised variational inference, self-supervised learning representations, detecting scientifically intersting anomalies and rare objects in large unlabelled datasets
